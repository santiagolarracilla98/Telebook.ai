# TeleBook

TeleBook is a data-driven platform for **Amazon book resellers** to source wholesale books with confidence, **calculate true ROI after fees**, and make faster, smarter buying decisions across **UK and US** marketplaces.

## What TeleBook does

**Three dashboards (Freemium / Member / Host)**  
  - **Freemium:** browse the book catalog + **basic ROI** view, with a **cart** to shortlist titles.  
  - **Registered Member:** unlock the **full TeleBook experience** — complete ROI engine, UK/US comparisons, deeper market data, and advanced tools.  
  - **Host (Admin):** manage the platform — **connect/disconnect APIs**, maintain the **books repository**, and control data sources & system settings.

- **Smart ROI / Profit Engine** – calculates net profit and ROI using Amazon fees (e.g., FBA/FBM), estimated shipping, taxes/VAT assumptions, and target margins.
- **Dual-Market Comparator (UK vs US)** – compares fees, FX, and expected profit across marketplaces so you can see where the same ISBN performs best.
- **Market Snapshot + Price History** – highlights current price ranges, demand signals, and historical pricing to avoid dead inventory and margin traps.
- **Inventory & ISBN Discovery** – search/browse by ISBN, title, author, category, publisher (and quickly evaluate a list).
- **Supplier Verification & Trust Scoring** – helps validate suppliers and reduce counterfeit / low-quality risk.
- **Alerts & Sensitivity Tools** – margin alerts, profit sensitivity simulations (fees/price/FX), and “what-if” scenarios.
- **AI Assistant (optional)** – conversational help for sourcing, ROI questions, and quick decision support.

## Who it’s for

- Amazon book sellers sourcing **wholesale/bulk**
- Arbitrage sellers who want a more rigorous **fee + ROI** workflow
- Operators comparing **UK/US** profit opportunities
